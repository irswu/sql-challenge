# sql-practice

The purpose of this project is to do a research project about people whom Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company) employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

For this project, I have designed the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, imported the CSV files into a SQL database, and then analyzed the data. 

As a whole, I performed data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.
